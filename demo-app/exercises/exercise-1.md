# Exercise 1

1. Create two types: 

#### Student
 - firstName: string
 - lastName: string

#### Teacher
 - firstName: string
 - lastName: string


2. Create an array of three elements for each type (a total of two arrays).

3. Create a function similar to myMap named myForEach. When the myForEach function runs, it simplies runs the passed function for each item in the passed in array. Similar to the JavaScript example below.

```javascript
const nums = [1,2,3,4,5];

nums.forEach(num => {
  console.log(num);
});
```

4. Call myForEach for the array of students and teachers. For the students, output their name using the format `lastName, firstName`. For the teacher, output their names using the format `firstName lastName`.

5. Ensure it works.
